# CS-330

In this project, I chose a 2D scene to recreate in 3D. I created a plane and then used basic 3D shapes to recreate the objects, adding color, textures, camera control, and lighting. Learning all of the new functions in this class for creating a 3D scene was essential in bringing the scene to life. I added each element of the scene one week at a time- first creating the shapes, then adding textures, lighting, etc., receiving feedback on each one before I moved on to the next. This is probably how I will approach future projects when given the chance, just on a faster timetable. Making sure everything was right before moving on to the next thing was a huge factor in my success. As we progressed throughout the milestones, I became much more comfortable with making changes and adding new things. Changing the attributes of a shape or color became second nature to me and I could easily find what I was looking for by week 4. Thanks to understanding more about computer graphics and visualizations, I now know how to create 3D shapes and transform them to render a basic 3D scene. I can use this in the future to work on things such as graphics or video games.
